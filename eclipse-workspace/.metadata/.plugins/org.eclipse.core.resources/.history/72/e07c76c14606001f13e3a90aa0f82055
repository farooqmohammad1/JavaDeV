The Main class has instance variables id and acc that are not initialized explicitly. 
When you create an object of Main using Main m = new Main();,
 the instance variables id and acc are set to their default values, which is 0 for integers in Java.

In your Main class, you have a method setValue() that sets the values of id and acc.
 However, you never call this method in your central class. Hence, when you call getValue() on the Main object m, the values of id and acc remain 0 since you never set them using setValue(). 
That's why it prints 0.
